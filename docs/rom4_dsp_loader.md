# ROM4 DSP loader contract

## Current result

The NSE-1 v5.30 MCU drives a real staged DSP boot. A cold transfer runs through
loader1 at DSP address `0x0f00`, the MCU asserts DSP reset, and a second release
preserves DARAM. Loader1 then requests block `0x12`; the matching descriptor
installs loader2 at `0x0d80`. Loader2 enters the run-mode dispatcher, which
requests further blocks by catalogue index.

This result no longer requires the compatibility path that copied words from a
flat DSP image into `0x2000..0x27ff`. Its old explanation was wrong: loader2
does not clear that range. Loader1 itself populates the resident branch table
with a repeated MVDP data-to-program transfer.

## Descriptor fields

The six halfwords in each recovered catalogue record are:

| Word | Current meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | DSP destination | Matches loader2 home `0x0d80` and later installed block homes. |
| 1 | transform/decoder selector | Stable within block families; values such as `0x1e80` and `0x0b39` are callable DSP addresses. Exact algorithm names remain open. |
| 2 | remaining output words | Block 2 falls `0x011c -> 0x00a4 -> 0x002c` as its destination advances by `0x78` words per chunk. |
| 3 | staging address | Stable during a block and points into the loader's low-DARAM work area. |
| 4 | input chunk length | Matches the upload-header values observed at each transfer. It need not equal output length. |
| 5 | flags | Zero in the recovered 27-record catalogue; no semantics assigned. |

The multi-chunk observation is important: catalogue records describe a
transform from staged input to an output range, not a direct flat-memory copy.
Tools must therefore not reconstruct DARAM by copying bytes following a
descriptor to word 0.

## Observed lifecycle

The normalized ordered trace is:

1. loader1 receives the cold double-buffer stream and the first DSP release;
2. reset is asserted after the cold transfer;
3. descriptor 0 (`fd00 ff80 0244 0500 0078 0000`) is installed and acknowledged;
4. the warm release resets CPU state while preserving DARAM;
5. DSP request `0x12` selects descriptor 18 and installs loader2 at `0x0d80`;
6. run mode requests block 1, then block families with input lengths `0x0078`,
   `0x0118`, and `0x04ec`.

`make check-c54x-rom4-cold-execute` independently starts the local clean-room
core at the mask-ROM reset vector with only the recovered program image and
complete `0xb000..0xefff` DROM populated. Reset reaches PC `0x0f00`, where the
program word is still zero, and stops at PC `0x0f01`. This is the expected MCU
upload boundary: loader1 is not resident in the mask image and isolated DSP
execution cannot proceed by pre-seeding it.

`tools/dsp_rom4_upload_trace_check.py` verifies this ordering and rejects an
observed input length absent from the recovered catalogue.

The local MAME tree contains a selectable `nokia_dsp_c54x_device` backend. It
maps DSP data addresses `0x0800..0x0fff`
directly onto DSPIF's existing MCU-visible shared store and resolves program
accesses in `0x0080..0x27ff` through the same data store while `PMST.OVLY` is
set. The host doorbell latches C54x `HPINT` (maskable source 9, vector 25).
The `noki5110` research configuration selects it instead of the HLE. NSE-1
firmware now uploads loader1 through ordinary HPI writes, drives the recovered
hold/release sequence, and executes the uploaded code. The current handset
frontier is the first still-unimplemented instruction at DSP PC `0x0f71`;
COBBA serial and PCM I/O remain unconnected.

The retained NSE-1 trace fixes reset polarity and edge behavior without an
inference: MCU writes to MAD2 byte `0x20002` are `1` (cold release), `0`
(hold), `0`, then `1` (warm release). A later value `3` leaves the DSP running.
MAD2 now exports this product-mask-derived level to the backend; the C54x
implementation drives the CPU reset input so CPU state restarts while the
external DSPIF/on-chip DARAM stores survive the warm transition.

## Resolved flat-image dependency

Before the decoder correction, sampled words at
`0x2000`, `0x216a`, `0x2286`, `0x23c3`, `0x2470`, `0x25b4`, and `0x27ff` are all
zero. Subsequent demand loads populate catalogue-owned ranges, but the gap
`0x23c3..0x25b3` is outside every declared destination. Without the assist the
co-sim completes 70 rather than 74 DSP acknowledgements and does not reach a
stable UI.

The gap's bytes occur in MCU flash, but location alone is not a destination
proof. In particular, the bytes matching `0x23c3..0x25b3` immediately follow
descriptor 0, whose declared output destination is `0xfd00`. They may be
encoded input, shared source material, or an artefact of how the recovered flat
image combined address spaces.

The producer is loader1 at `0x0f1f..0x0f28`. It computes a count from the
`0x23c4..0x252a` bounds, selects source `0x0d00`, and executes repeated MVDP to
program destination `0x23c4`. With `PMST.OVLY=1`, those program stores must
resolve to the same DARAM cells used by program fetches.

The experimental C54x core instead wrote MVDP directly to its immutable
`prog[]` store, bypassing the existing `prog_write()` helper and leaving the
overlay cells zero. Routing MVDP through `prog_write()` removes `SEEDDARAM`:
the unassisted 30-million-instruction run returns to 74 acknowledgements, 19
DSP ring transitions, 16 host doorbells, eight codec-frame interrupts, and a
stable interactive framebuffer. This is an instruction-semantics correction,
not a reconstructed image or timing adjustment.
